2. [How to configure Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/ui/auth/integrating-your-first-screen)ðŸ‘‰[This page is archived and might not reflect the latest version of the FlutterFire plugins. You can find the latest information on GitHub:](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/blob/master/packages/flutterfire_ui/doc/auth/integrating-your-first-screen.md)
## Important note

Due to privacy I removed some files from specific location mention below:

1. lib/firebase_options.dart
2. android/app/google-services.json
3. ios/firebase_app_id_file.json
4. ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

So once you configure your project with firebase then place your configuration files on the proper place as mention above.
